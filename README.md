# iOS-Wallpapers

## History
This app was supposed to be launched by the end of January, but a rejection by Apple due to Intelectual Property lead me without any option on publishing in into the App Store

## About the app
iOS Wallpapers was built entirely using SwiftUI, it has been also combined with the fantastic library called Kingfished, which made me able to load all the wallpapers and app assets from an external server to highly reduce the app size which at the beggining was more than 800mb and at the end it was less than 20mb. Also, the app has been made following the MVVM architecture (Model-View-ViewModel)

## How to build
As this app is not going to be on the App Store, you cannot download it from there but you can build the app in your own so you can use it whenever you want, just follow this little guide:
  - **Step 1**: Download the project from GitHub
  - **Step 2**: Download the Apple's IDE XCode from the Mac App Store
  - **Step 3**: Open the project in XCode and trust it (you will get an advice when you open the project for the first time)
  - **Step 4**: In XCode, with the project opened, go to XCode in the upper macOS menu, and click in preferences, there go to Accounts and click in 'Add Account', there just add your Apple ID
  - **Step 5**: Then, connect with a cable your device into your Mac, select it in XCode and finally run the app in your device
  
That's it! Then you should be able to use the app in your device without any problem.
